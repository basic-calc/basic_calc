## Description

BasicCalc is a small, command-line calculator that performs the standard four mathematical functions and more (remainder, circumference of circle given radius, etc.) written using Python3. ðŸ§®

## Installation

Download the latest release on the right of the main repo page, extract it using an unzipper (WinRar, 7Zip, unzip command for Linux aficionados, etc.), and scroll down until you find a file named something similar to "calc.exe" for your operation system. This file is the calculator. Enjoy! :)
